An IOIO python module

This is very very alpha.

Basic Usage
------

import ioio
i = ioio.IOIO('/dev/ttyACM0')


Module layout:
------

    ioio.IOIO : main class
        Contains a board, interface, and protocol (see below)

    ioio.boards : IOIO boards
        Contains information about what a given board supports
        Stores information about board state

    ioio.interfaces : IOIO communication interfaces
        Different ways to communicate with an IOIO board
        Each must support:
            connect/disconnect
            read/write

    ioio.protocols : IOIO protocols
        Abstraction to (hopefully) support multiple IOIO protcol versions
