Protocol
------

1) on connection, receive
    a) type byte \x00
    b) magic (4) = 'IOIO'
    b) hardware version (8)
    c) board version (8)
    d) firmware version (8)

to board packages I think go:
type -> args -> var_args

Tests
------

<attempt> = <sent> [<received>]
soft reset = \x01 []
check interface = \x02 00000000 [\x02 \x00]
set digital pin = \x03 \x01 \x00 []
